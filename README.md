## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```sh
python --version
```

If you don't have Python 3.10 installed, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Installing Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment
When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```sh
deactivate
```

## Running the Project
After setting up everything, you can run your Python scripts as usual:

```sh
python your_script.py
```

Enjoy coding!
